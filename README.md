# welcome!

I am trying to learn data science, machine learning and deep learning basics using real datasets that I got from kaggle.com (or similar websites) and am trying to manipulate data, decide according to a real dataset, learn visualizing and building a model to predict. These are my trials. 

Within time, I will upload my notebooks written in different categories of AI and accordingly decide, which one I love the most.
